# SPA-dandd

SPA-dandd is a way to practice creating a single-page application using HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, all while hitting a public Dungeons and Dragons API, returning JSON data. 

To run this application, simply save the html and js file in a folder, open your local machine's terminal, and type "open dandd.html".
